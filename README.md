# NewPong
First Publish
This is my first project for Unreal Engine 4 I have put on GitHub.

Desired Platform Release
I initially created this game with hopes to create a mobile/tablet pong game.

Desired Game Features
-The game has two modes: original and survival.
-In original mode, you could play the AI or another player.
-In survival mode, you could play against another player.

Current status - Work in Progress
- The basics are mostly implemented of both modes are implememented.
- I changed some implementation of the pong ball hitting a pong actor so I need to reimplement the scoring system in the origingal mode.
- I think there are some sizing issues with the meshes when choosing a difficulty.
